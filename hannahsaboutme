Hi! My name is Hannah Meharg. I am a sophomore at UVM studying computer science and data science. Although I am studying technology, I have always had a love for art. In order to keep me sane with a full cs course load, I am a gallery guard at UVMâ€™s Fleming Museum. I have found my time there very peaceful and enjoyable and a time to take a step back from technology. Last year, I was so fortunate to see the works of Basquiat, Andy Warhol, and Keith Haring, three of my favorite artists, all in one exhibition at Flemings. Another favorite artist of mine is Yayoi Kusama. One of her famous Infinity Mirror was just installed at the David Wirner gallery in NYC and I am very excited to see it when I get home.
